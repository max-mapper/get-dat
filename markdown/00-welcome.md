**get-dat** is a tutorial that teaches you how to work with datasets using [dat](http://dat-data.com/). 

To the left there is a terminal that is connected to a private server that has the `dat` CLI tool installed. 

In this panel you will find step by step instructions for this tutorial. There are navigation links at the **bottom** of each page.

On the bottom there is a file browser and text editor that is **connected to the same server** that the terminal is logged on to.

You can double-click files in the file browser to open them, and editing text in the text editor **auto-saves** your changes to the server.

**When you leave or close this webpage your server will be shut down.**

Ok, now we're ready to dive in!
