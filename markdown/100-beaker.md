# Extra Credit: Host your site in Beaker

[Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/) is a browser built on Dat. It's fun to play with, it enables sercure sharing of data through the browser, and Beaker makes it super easy to host a website. We :heart: Beaker Browser!

[Install beaker on your machine](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/install/)

To see the data you've been working with, simply type the Dat-link (generated by the `dat share` command in the virtual terminal) into the **Beaker browser address bar**: 

`dat://83726...whatever-your-link-is-goes-here...a594/`

If you haven't added an index.html, Beaker should show you something like this:

If you've added an index.html file, it will render the html and look more like this:

You can send the dat link to a friend and they can fork and edit their version of the site. They can also download the files.

Sites on Beaker can be saved to a library to view offline.
